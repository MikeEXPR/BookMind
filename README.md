## Description

*"Read What You Love Until You Love to Read."* — **Naval Ravikant**

**BookMind** is an innovative reading companion designed to transform how people engage with books, inspired by Mortimer J. Adler's timeless work, *How to Read a Book*. BookMind blends cutting-edge AI with immersive features to empower users to become analytical, thoughtful, and deeply engaged readers.

By combining AI mentorship and interactive reading tools, BookMind aims to:

- **Guide readers step-by-step** through Adler's framework with personalized feedback and actionable insights.  
- **Leverage OpenAI’s GPT and Whisper AI** for real-time, conversational support and voice interactions.  
- **Integrate Google Cloud Vision OCR** to allow users to scan and interact with physical books.  
- **Create a seamless and interactive reading experience** with quizzes, discussions, and audio narration.  
- **Make reading engaging and gamified**, driving comprehension and mastery of texts.

BookMind is more than a reading app—it's a platform for lifelong learning and intellectual empowerment.

*"We must be more than a nation of functional literates. We must become a nation of truly competent readers, recognizing all that the word competent implies. Nothing less will satisfy the needs of the world that is coming."* — **Mortimer J. Adler**
